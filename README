= Login Candy

This extension allows you to give all your users an API key.

It also allows you provide a login to users, that you may not want to have access to your admin interface.

For example your site has members. They need a login to look at all their messages. But you don't want to create a role for members, nor do you want them to access the admin interface.

Just sublcass your User model

class Member < User

end

Now when you create a member set their "access" rights to 'front' which means they can only see the front-end of your app.

Member.new(:access => 'front');

Now when the member logs in they will be redirected to 

www.myapp/visitors

If you want them to be redirected to www.myapp/members

then just set Radiant::Config['login.visitor_url'] = '/members'

Your visitors also have an API key so they can acccess your app through the API. You'll need to write your own restrictions though.
